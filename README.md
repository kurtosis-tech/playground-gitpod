Welcome to the Kurtosis Playground!
===================================

Here you have:

- The `kurtosis` CLI installed, with tab-completion enabled
- The Kurtosis VSCode plugin installed, which provides syntax highlighting and tab-completion for all `.star` files

Any ports made available through Kurtosis can be accessed with the pane in the very bottom-right corner of the screen.

If you'd like to work on your own machine, you can always [install the Kurtosis CLI locally](https://docs.kurtosis.com/install).

### Ideas

- Try [the quickstart](https://docs.kurtosis.com/quickstart) (we've already created an empty `quickstart` directory for you)
- Try running one of the packages in the [Awesome Kurtosis](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/awesome-kurtosis) repo (instructions on doing so in the link)
- Play around with adding [Starlark instructions](https://docs.kurtosis.com/starlark-reference) to the `main.star` file in the `fresh-package` directory, running it with `kurtosis run main.star`
- Write your own package
